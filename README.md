# Pulse v1

## Overview

Pulse v1 is an event planning application designed to connect people with events or other individuals within their vicinity based on shared interests. The application leverages geolocation, user profiles, and real-time event management to display a personalized event feed. Users can create events, RSVP to events, and manage their profiles. Authentication is handled via Firebase Authentication, and global state is managed using React Context. This project is built with React Native, Expo, and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Event Discovery:**

  - Displays a dynamic, location-based feed of events.
  - Filters events based on user-selected interests.
  - Pull-to-refresh and manual refresh on the home screen.

- **User Profiles:**

  - Users can create and edit profiles (name, email, interests).
  - Profile data is stored locally using AsyncStorage.
  - Preferences influence the event feed.

- **Event Management:**
  - Users can create events (via the CreatePulse screen) including event details such as name, category, date, description, and an optional maximum attendee limit.
  - Organizers can view the RSVP count for each event.
  - Users can RSVP or cancel their RSVP from the EventDetails screen.
- **Authentication:**
  - Users sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication (email/password).
  - The app uses a conditional navigation flow to switch between authentication screens and the main app.
- **Global Event Context:**
  - A React Context manages event data globally, ensuring that updates (such as RSVP counts) are reflected throughout the app.
- **Security & Licensing:**
  - Project source code is now protected under **All Rights Reserved** license.
